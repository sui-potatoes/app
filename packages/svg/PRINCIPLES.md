# API Design Principles


## 1. **Consistency**

Each module needs to be consistent in its design. This means that the same patterns / conventions
should be used throughout the package. This includes naming, method signatures and return values.

## 2. **Building over modification**

The goal of this library is to provide useful APIs for constructing new values, even if it means
sacrificing some modification capabilities. Builder pattern with its ease of chaining is preferred
over declaring a variable and modifying it afterwards.
