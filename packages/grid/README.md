## Installing

### [Move Registry CLI](https://docs.suins.io/move-registry)

```bash
mvr add @potatoes/grid
```

### Manual

To add this library to your project, add this to your `Move.toml` file under
`[dependencies]` section:f

```toml
# goes into [dependencies] section
grid = { git = "https://github.com/sui-potatoes/grid.git", subdir = "packages/grid", rev = "grid@v1" }
```

Exported address of this package is:

```toml
grid = "0x..."
```

## Usage

> For example applications build with the `Grid`, [see examples](https://github.com/sui-potatoes/app/tree/main/packages/grid/examples)

The package features 4 modules, each implementing a feature:

-   `grid::grid` - defines the `Grid` type and its methods
-   `grid::point` - defines the `Point` type
-   `grid::direction` - implements direction bitmaps
-   `grid::cursor` - defines the `Cursor` type and its methods

### Coordinates System

In the library, the `x` coordinate stands for the row, and `y` stands for the column. Zero position `(0, 0)` is top-left.

Grid is a generic container for any `T`, which offers variety of built-in methods and macros for custom implementations. It
is built in an "interface"-like manner, where dependents of the Grid can choose to implement any of the available methods by
wrapping macro calls.

#### General Grid Methods

### Point

> For full reference, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/sui-potatoes/app/tree/main/packages/grid/docs/point.md).

Point represents a `Point` on a plane as `x` and `y` coordinates, where `x` is the row, and `y` is the column.

```move
use grid::point;

#[test]
fun test_point() {
    // create a `Point` at `(0, 1)`
    let point = point::new(0, 1);
    let (x, y) = point.into_values();

    // get all Moore neighbors of the Point
    // excludes the point
    let moore_neighbors = point.moore(1);

    // get all Von-Neumann neighbors of the Point
    // excludes the point
    let von_neumann_neighbors = point.von_neumann(1);

    // prints as a pair: `(1, 2)`
    let printed = point.to_string();
}
```

### Direction

> For full reference, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/sui-potatoes/app/tree/main/packages/grid/docs/direction.md).

Grid directions are defined as a bitmap of 4 bits, where each each bit marks `up`, `down`, `left` or `right`, and a mix gives the
diagonals: `up` | `right` = `up_right`. Because of this property, direction macros can be combined and compared using bitwise operators.

```move
use grid::direction;

#[test]
fun test_direction() {
    let up = direction::up!();
    let up_left = up | direction::left!(); // bitwise OR sums directions
    let is_up = up_left & direction::up!() > 0; // bitwise AND can be used to check if a specific direction is present

    // inverse! returns an opposite direction
    let _down_right = direction::inverse!(up_left);

    // lastly, `direction!` macro computes the direction bitmap from coordinates
    let down = direction::direction!(0, 0, 2, 0); // x increase -> direction = down

    assert!(down & direction::down!() > 0);
}
```

### Cursor

> For full reference, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/sui-potatoes/app/tree/main/packages/grid/docs/cursor.md).

Cursor is a special type which can be moved using directions. It can come handy in certain scenarios by abstracting away
coordinates. It is tightly coupled with `direction` module and supports conversion to and from `Point`.

```move
use grid::cursor;
use grid::direction;

#[test]
fun test_cursor() {
    let mut cursor = cursor::new(0, 0);
    cursor.move_to(direction::down!());

    assert!(cursor.to_vector() == vector[1, 0]);

    // additionally, it has "memory" and can go back
    cursor.move_back();

    assert!(cursor.to_vector() == vector[0, 0]);
}
```
