## Codec - ultimate encoding solution ([source code](https://github.com/sui-potatoes/app/tree/main/packages/codec))

"Codec" implements a number of encodings in a single package. It can be used for different applications, such as encoding images for the web, or encoding data for storing on the blockchain.

> See the [README](https://github.com/sui-potatoes/app/tree/main/packages/codec) for usage and installation instructions.

```move
use codec::urlencode;

let encoded = urlencode::encode(b"Hello, World!");
let decoded = urlencode::decode(&encoded);

assert!(decoded == b"Hello, World!");
```

Full list of supported encodings in v1:

-   `codec::hex`
-   `codec::base64`
-   `codec::potatoes`
-   `codec::urlencode`
